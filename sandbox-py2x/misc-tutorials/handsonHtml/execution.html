<p>It is time to put longer collections of instructions together. That
is most easily done by creating a text file and running the Python
interpreter on the file. Idle simplifies that process.</p>
<p>First you can put an existing file into an Idle Edit Window. Click
on the Idle <span class="guilabel">File</span> menu and select <span class="guilabel">Open</span>.
(Or as you see, you can use
the shortcut <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl-O</span></code>. That means holding down the <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl</span></code>
key, and
pressing the letter <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">O</span></code> for Open.) You should get a file selection
dialog. You should have the sample program madlib.py displayed in
the list. Select it and open it. (If you do not see the program,
then you either failed to download the example programs in
<a class="reference internal" href="idle.html#your-python-folder"><span>Your Python Folder and Python Examples</span></a>, or you did not start Idle in the
proper folder in <a class="reference internal" href="idle.html#starting-idle"><span>Starting Idle</span></a>.)</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="index-2">
<dt>Mac</dt>
<dd>In Windows it does not matter whether you go to the filemenu of
the Shell Window or an edit window, but it does make a difference
on a Mac:
If you use the Idle File menu when the Shell window is active,
your search will start in your Documents folder,
but if some file editing window is active instead,
your search will start in its folder (generally the desired behavior).</dd>
</dl>
<p id="index-3">You will see the source code again. Now run this program from
inside of Idle: Go to the <span class="guilabel">Run</span> menu of that Edit window, and select
<span class="guilabel">Run Module</span>. Notice the shortcut (F5).</p>
<p>If the Shell window does not automatically come to the foreground,
select it. You should see a line saying <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RESTART</span></code> and then the
start of the execution of the Mad Lib program with the cursor
waiting for your entry after the first prompt. Finish executing the
program. Be sure to type the final requested Enter, so you get back
to the interpreter prompt: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>Look at the editor window again. You should see that different
parts of the code have different colors. String literals are likely
green. The reserved words <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">def</span></code> are likely orange. Look at the
last two lines, where the identifier <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tellStory</span></code> is black, and
the identifier <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">input</span></code> is likely purple. Only identifiers that
are not predefined by Python are black. If <em>you</em> create an
identifier name, make sure Idle shows it in <em>black</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-pre-python-3-3-idle-bug">
<span id="a-bug-possible"></span><span id="index-4"></span><h2>1.9.2. A Pre Python 3.3 Idle Bug<a class="headerlink" href="#a-pre-python-3-3-idle-bug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Luckily this bug was fixed for Python 3.3</em>, but if for some reason you are using
an older version and cannot update to the current version, read on:</p>
<p>When you execute a program from the Idle Editor, the interpreter
gives a banner saying <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RESTART</span></code>, meaning that all the things you
defined in any shell session so far are wiped clean and the program
you are running starts fresh. There is one egregious exception to
that, that was still present at least in the version of Idle for
Python 3.1 in Windows. We will try to demonstrate the bug. (A <em>bug</em>
is an error in a program.)</p>
<p>Start running the Mad Lib program again by going to the Editor
Window containing madlib.py, and start running the program again,
but do not continue....</p>
<p>You should see a prompt for user input generated by the program.
Ignore this prompt and go back to the Edit Window and start the Mad
Lib program again.</p>
<p>If this bug is still present, you should see a difference in this
restart: This time after the RESTART banner and the interpreter
prompt: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>, which looks innocent enough, but this program
<em>should</em> show the <em>program&#8217;s</em> prompt string for input, and with
the bug, Idle does not show the program&#8217;s prompt.</p>
<p>The problem only comes up because you interrupted the last
execution <em>when user input was being waited for</em>. The restart was not
complete here: The system is still looking for the pending user
input from the last execution.</p>
<p>The fix is simple: Make sure the Interpreter Window is the
currently selected window, and press return to terminate the lost
user input. In some circumstances, you may need to press return a
second time.</p>
<p>After that the program should start up normally with its prompt.</p>
<p>Watch out for this behavior, and remember the fix.</p>

<span id="the-classic-first"></span><span id="index-5"></span><h2>1.9.3. The Classic First Program<a class="headerlink" href="#the-classic-first-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Make sure you have Idle started in your Python directory (in
Windows with the provided Idle shortcut link), where you will store
program files.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Do <em>not</em> start Idle from the Windows Start Menu!</p>
</div>
<p>If you just started Idle now, you may already have a blank Edit
Window in front of you. If not, open a new window by going to the
File menu and selecting New Window. This gives you a rather
conventional text editing window with the mouse available, ability
to cut and paste, plus a few special options for Python.</p>
<p>Type (or paste) the following into the <em>editor</em> window:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Save the file with the menu sequence <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Save</span>,
and then enter the file
name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hello.py</span></code>. Python program files should always be given a
name ending in &#8221;.py&#8221;, and you must enter the .py extension
explicitly .</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="index-6">
<dt>Mac</dt>
<dd>Save updates a file using its current name.
If you want to save a copy to a different name, you must be careful:
use <span class="menuselection">File ‣ Save Copy As</span>, <em>NOT</em>
<span class="menuselection">File ‣ Save As</span>.
The latter saves a copy of the Shell history,
not the program you are editing!
Sometimes you might want a record of the Shell history,
but this is not usually what you want.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you look in the editor, you should see that your text is color
coded. The editor will color different parts of Python syntax in
special colors.</p>
<p>Now that you have a complete, saved program, choose
<span class="menuselection">Run ‣ Run Module</span>.
You should see the program run in the Python Shell window.</p>
<p>You just wrote and executed a program. Unlike when you use the
shell, this code is saved to a file in your Python folder. You can
open and execute the file any time you want. (In Idle, use
<span class="menuselection">File ‣ Open</span>.)</p>
<p id="index-7">To the interpreter, a program source file is a Python
<em>module</em>. We will tend to use the more general term: a program file
is a module. Note the term from the menu when running the program.</p>
<p id="index-8"><em>Distinguish program code from Shell text</em>: It is easy to confuse
the Shell and the Edit windows. Make sure you keep them straight.
The hello.py program is just the line</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>that you typed into the edit window and saved. When you ran the
program in Idle, you saw results in the Shell. First came the
Restart notice, the one-line output from the program saying hello,
and a further Shell prompt:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="o">================================</span> <span class="n">RESTART</span> <span class="o">========</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="go">Hello world!</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You could also have typed this single printing line directly in the
Shell in response to a Shell prompt. When you see
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>, you could enter the
print function and get the exchange between you and the Shell:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Hello world&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Hello world!</span>
<span class="go">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The three lines above are <em>not</em> a program you could save in a file
and run. This is just an exchange in the <em>Shell</em>, with its
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code> prompts, individual
line to execute and the response.</p>
<p>Again, just the single line, with
no <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>,</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">entered into the <em>Edit</em> window forms a program you can save and
run.</p>
</div>
<p>We will shortly get to more interesting many-statement
programs, where it is much more convenient to use the Edit window
than the Shell!</p>
<p><em>The general assumption in this Tutorial will be that programs are</em>
<em>run in Idle and the Idle Shell is the Shell referred to.</em>
It will be explicitly stated when you should run a program directly
from the operating system.</p>
<p>In general it is fine to run our programs
from a cmd console (Windows) or terminal (Mac).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Running the text based example programs in Windows, like birthday2.py,
by selecting them to run from a file folder, will <em>not</em> work well:
The program ends and the window automatically closes before you can
see the final output.</p>
</div>
<p>On a Mac you get to explicitly close the terminal window created when you run a Python
program from the Finder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="program-documentation-string">
<span id="index-9"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>1.9.4. Program Documentation String<a class="headerlink" href="#program-documentation-string" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The program above is self evident, and shows how short and direct a
program can be (unlike other languages such as Java). Still, right
away, get used to documenting a program. Python has a special
feature: If the beginning of a program is just a quoted string,
that string is taken to be the program&#8217;s <em>documentation string</em>.
Open the example file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hello2.py</span></code> in the Edit window:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="sd">&#39;&#39;&#39;A very simple program,</span>
<span class="sd">showing how short a Python program can be!</span>
<span class="sd">Authors: ___, ___</span>
<span class="sd">&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>

<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Hello world!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c">#This is a stupid comment after the # mark</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Most commonly, the initial documentation goes on for several lines,
so a multi-line string delimiter is used (the triple quotes). Just
for completeness of illustration in this program, another form of
comment is also shown, a comment that starts with the symbol <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></code> and
extends to the end of the line. The Python interpreter completely
ignores this form of comment. Such a comment should only be
included for better human understanding. Avoid making comments that
do not really aid human understanding. (Do what I say, not what I
did above.) Good introductory comment strings and appropriate names
for the parts of your programs make fewer <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></code> symbol comments
needed.</p>
<p>Run the program and see the documentation and comment make no
difference in the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="screen-layout">
<span id="index-10"></span><h2>1.9.5. Screen Layout<a class="headerlink" href="#screen-layout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of course you can arrange the windows on your computer screen any
way that you like. A suggestion as you start to use the combination
of the editor to write, the shell to run, and the tutorial to
follow along: Make all three mostly visible your computer screen at
once. Drag the editor window to the upper left. Place the Shell
window to the lower left, and perhaps reduce its height a bit so
there is not much overlap. If you are looking at the web version of
the tutorial on the screen, make it go top to bottom on the right,
but not overlap the Idle windows too much. The web page rendering
should generally adapt to the width pretty well. You can always
temporarily maximize the window. Before resizing the browser
window, it is good to look for an unusual phrase on your page, and
search for it after resizing, since resizing can totally mess up
your location in the web page.</p>
<p>There is an alternative to maximization for the Idle editor window:
It you want it to go top to bottom of the screen but not widen, you
can toggle that state with <code class="kbd docutils literal"><span class="pre">Alt-2</span></code>. Play with all this.</p>
