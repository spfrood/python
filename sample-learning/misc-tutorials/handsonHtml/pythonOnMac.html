<h1 class="title">Some Special Mac Instructions</h1>

<p>I will assume a version of Max OSX of at least El Capitan (10.11 or later).  Upgrades are free.</p>
<p><em>This document supercedes any conflicting instructions in the tutorial itself.</em>
As versions of Python and operating systems have changed, some old usage instructions get out
date.</p>
<div class="section" id="versions">
<h1>Versions</h1>
<p>I will use Python 3.6+ to mean the current version of Python, with version number at least
3.6.1.  Make sure you have the latest recommended version installed from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.
Download the pkg filke and double click to execute.  As you install, note the warning about the graphics support
package Tcl/Tk as described on
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/">https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/</a></p>
<p>In particular, it probably says that El Capitan, OSX 10.11 users should go to the Active State website
and install the package.  The version suggested by Python.org, 8.5.18.0 has a link near the bottom of the page.
Do not use version 8.6.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-login-id">
<h1>Your Login ID</h1>
<p>The normal place for you to have my examples folder is under your home folder,
which has the same name as your Login ID. If you are just creating a login ID,
it will save some hassle in Chapter 4, if your login ID does
<em>not have a space in it</em>.
&quot;Andy&quot; or &quot;AndyHarrington&quot; would be fine for me, but</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Andy Harrington&quot;</blockquote>
<p>would bomb the server in Chapter 4.</p>
<div class="section" id="if-you-have-a-blank-in-your-login-id">
<span id="blank-in-id"></span><h2>If You Have a Blank in your Login ID</h2>
<p>The local server program central to chapter 4 bombs with
folder paths with a blank in the name.</p>
<p>If you have a blank in your Login ID, it is not so easy to change.
Instead make a folder outside of your home folder:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to the Macintosh HD folder and create a folder (like &quot;comp150&quot;)
with no blank in it!  You will need administrative privileges,
and will be prompted to enter your password.</li>
<li>I suggest that you move my examples folder, or just the subfolder
www so it is under your new folder.  For Chapter 4
test my examples and add your work there.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="folder-for-my-examples">
<span id="examples-folder"></span><h1>Folder For My Examples</h1>
<p>Wherever you plan to unzip my Python examples folder from
<a class="reference external" href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/examples.zip">http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/examples.zip</a>
you need to make sure that
my www folder, and any other folder where you put later .cgi files
does not have a blank in its name,
<em>or any folder in which it is a subfolder</em>.
If you have a &quot;comp 150&quot; folder, you might rename it &quot;comp150&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-vs-editing">
<h1>Running VS. Editing</h1>
<div class="section" id="editing-by-default">
<span id="edit-by-default"></span><h2>Editing by Default</h2>
<p>You will be working mostly with files ending in .py -- Python source files.
Most of the time you will be editing them and running them in IDLE, so the best
default behavior when opening a file with extension .py is to have it open in
Idle 3.6+.  If you can double click on a .py file in my examples,
and Idle opens as soon as you have installed Python 3.6+, great.
If not, here is how to change the default behavior:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In the Finder go to a  file in my examples folder with the .py extension.
and right click or control click on it. Select <strong>Get Info</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Info window that pops up, In the dropdown menu for <strong>Open with:</strong>,
you want to see
<strong>IDLE.app</strong> on the top line (meaning it is already the default).
You may possibly also see the version listed if you have several.  Presumably
you are going through this because you do <em>not</em> see IDLE.app there.</li>
<li>You may see <strong>IDLE.app</strong> lower down in the list of options.  Then select it there.</li>
<li>If you did not see IDLE.app in the dropdown list at all:<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Other...</strong>.</li>
<li>A window of app's pops up.
Toward the bottom is a checkbox for &quot;Always Open With&quot;.  Check it.</li>
<li>If you do not see a Python folder in the list, just below the bottom of
the page change Recommended Applications to All Applications</li>
<li>Now you should see a Python 3.6 folder.  Open it and select Idle.app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Info window should become active again.  Be sure that now under
<strong>Open with:</strong> you see IDLE.app.</li>
<li>Under the IDLE.app you should see a button, <strong>Change All...</strong>.
So that you never have to go through all these steps again, be sure to click
that button.  A confirmation window will pop up.  Select Continue.</li>
<li>Now you can close the Info window, and you should be able to open all .py
files directly in Idle for editing by double clicking in the Finder!</li>
</ol>
<!-- old
Setup of Preferences for Launching Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will sometimes want to run Python programs without Idle.  Assuming you do not
make this the default behavior, here is how to do it as necessary.
You use the Python Launcher (for the latest version of Python),
but the Python Launcher may need to be configured correctly:

#.  Type enough of "Python Launcher" into Spotlight so it comes up as a choice.
    If you have several versions of Python install,
    version numbers will be listed after different versions.
    Use the latest version.
#.  A Preferences window pops up for Python scripts.  Set the Interpreter to

       /usr/bin/python3

    That may mean just changing the last character from w to 3.
#.  Close the Preferences window.  You are set for launch.

Launching Python Programs Without Idle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have done the previous section's setup first.  Now:

#.  In the Finder go to the .py file you want (likely in my examples folder)
    and right click or control click on it. Select **Open With**.
#.  In the window that pops up, select "Python Launcher.app".
    If there are several, select the latest version.
    A terminal window should pop up, with your program started.
#.  If your program opens a graphics window,
    it may be all or partly covered by another window, so you may need
    to hunt around and click on its title bar to bring it forward. -->

<h2>Starting The Idle Shell</h2>
<p>Options</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use Spotlight with idle.app.  If there is more than one version of idle.app,
make sure you choose one for Python 3.6+.
This is a good approach the first time to check that
Idle is properly installed.
The disadvantage of this approach is that Idle
starts in your <em>Documents folder</em> (more below).</li>
<li>You may open a Python file ending in .py into an Idle Edit window by
selecting it directly in a Finder window if the defaults are set as
discussed above.  Instead you
can Ctrl-click on the file, select Open With, and then choose Idle
for Python 3.6+.</li>

   under Chapter 4. -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="opening-files-from-inside-idle">
<h2>Opening Files from Inside Idle</h2>
<p>You may select Open in the File menu <em>inside</em> Idle.</p>
<p><strong>Caution</strong>: the behavior
depends on what window is active at the moment, a file editing window or the Shell window:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the active window is some <strong>file editing</strong> window when you use the Idle
File menu to open a file,
your search will start in the same folder as the file you are editing
(generally the desired
behavior).</li>
<li>If you select File Open from
the <strong>Shell</strong> window, the starting folder depends on how you started Idle:<ul>
<li>If you started Idle from Spotlight or opened a file in the Finder,
then your search will start in your <strong>Documents</strong> folder,
probably not what you want.</li>

you gave the command to start Idle.</li>

<p>Important! Particularly if you later copy in a CGI script from a Windows
machine, or if you <em>create any new cgi script</em> in the www directory, make sure
it becomes executable (and possibly fix some other technical things) by
launching CGIfix.py again.</p>
<p>If you forget this, and the file is not executable,
nothing happens in the browser when you try to run it,
and the error message in the server window is very unhelpful -
it says  &quot;... File not found ...&quot;.  Make sure you make new CGI files
executable!</p>
<p>If you create and
edit a cgi file inside Idle, remember you <em>cannot run it</em> from inside
Idle.  After editing, be <strong>sure</strong> to check the syntax,
using alt/option-X.
You should close the file in Idle before running CGIfix.py.</p>
<p>When you want to test a cgi script, you first need to have launched
the local CGI Server, however
<em>opening and running localCGIServer.py in Idle does not work!</em></p>
<p>Instead make sure all your files needed by the cgi server
(.html, .cgi, localCGIServer.py) are in the
same folder as the file created there by fixCGI.py:  <tt class="docutils literal">cgiServerScript</tt>.
(Distinguish the separate file for Windows, startServer.cmd:  Ignore that.)</p>
<p>In the Finder double click on cgiServerScript.
This should start a window announcing the start of the CGI server.
(Then you can leave it running for as long
as you want to test .cgi files in the same folder.)  Do <em>not</em> have several
copies of the CGI server running at once!</p>
<p>At this point you can do all the web server based activities in Chapter
4, with the <em>only extra step being the running of CGIfix.py when you</em>
<em>create a new CGI script</em> in the www directory, or copy one from Windows.
There are a number of steps: be sure you carefully go through the list in the tutorial.
Remember, html files calling a cgi file, and cgi files used directly are <em>only</em> run in your web browser
with a URL starting with localhost:8080/.  Otherwise nothing dynamic happens.</p>
<!-- warning

I have been shown an apparent problem copying a partner's script from Windows,
that I though my CGIfix.py should handle, but it has not.
When transferring a cgi file from Windows, you may want to
open a new file window and then copy all the contnets in from a separately opened,
originally Windows
file.  Then save the new file and use CGIfix.py. -->
<!-- old
There are two setup issues to check, and then general instructions for
dealing with individual cgi programs.

Setup: Finding Python3 And Idle3 With a Terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The names python3 and idle3 generally refer to the latest versions
that run under Python 3.  You would like these to work in various contexts.

This section is for testing and fixing where things do not work as expected.

Open a terminal window (spotlight: Terminal)

Enter

      python3

If a Python shell starts, fine. Just press Crtl-D once to quit, and you have
found python3.

Also try

    idle3

**If idle3 or python3 did not start**, you will need to follow these instructions:

First check the location of the system Python files.  If you have
Python 3.3, try this terminal command:

   ls /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin

If you have Python 3.2, 3.4, ..., replace the 3.3 in the command above.

If your command does not cause an error, and shows python3 and idle3 listed,
enter the following terminal commands:

   ls /usr/local/bin

If python3 was *not* listed, copy and enter:

   sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin

You may be asked for your password.
*You may get no feedback as you type your password.*

This should have made python3 accessible.  Now test:  Again try the command

   python3

It should work now. End the command by entering Ctrl-D.

If python3 still did not work, try a further step: copy and enter:

   sudo ln -s  /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/bin

Now try the python3 command.  If it still did not work, get help.

If idle3 did not work, enter a similar line:

   sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/idle3 /usr/local/bin

Now test, starting idle3 from the command line.

If that did not work, do the backup:

   sudo ln -s  /usr/local/bin/idle3 /usr/bin

If the idle3 command does not work now, get help.


Idle From a Terminal - Opening CGI Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section assumes you successfully completed the previous section,
getting python3 and idle3 running from a terminal.

There is one annoying feature of Idle (and some other programs) on a Mac:
The Open File dialog inside
Idle only allows you to open files ending in .py or .txt, but not .cgi.
Before chapter 4 this is not generally an issue.

A way to get an existing CGI file into
Idle:

*  cd into the folder of the file
*  enter the command **idle3** *followed by the file name*.

For example you could edit and modify adder.cgi if you change to the
www
folder (inside the examples folder) and enter

   idle3 adder.cgi

Once you have opened a .cgi file this way, Idle should allow you to
reopen it later from the Recent Files menu option.

Setup: Making CGI scripts executable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have completed the previous section successfully before
going on to this section.

A complication on a Mac, like any Unix derived system, is that programs
that you run must be explicitly marked *executable*. (On Windows it follows from
the file extension, like .exe.)  The examples/www folder may not
have the cgi files marked executable.

The example program examples/www/CGIfix.py is needed to give direct
Unix/Mac/Linux executability to CGI files for Chapter 4 and for any
Python program in general.

Remember the www directory cannot have a directory name in the path down to
that directory with a space in it. If you got that wrong, move your files or
change the name of the offending folder if possible.

Change into your www directory. For example if the
example folder is directly in your desktop folder as in the example
above, then enter:

    cd ~/desktop/examples/www

Now make important files executable with the command:

    python3 CGIfix.py CGIfix.py localCGIServer.py

(Note CGIfix.py is entered twice, once as the Python file to interpret and once
again as a parameter to that program!)

Finish with the command:

   ./CGIfix.py

Do not forget the initial "./".
This should make all the example cgi scripts executable.

Running CGI Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important! Particularly if you later copy in a CGI script from a Windows
machine, or if you *create any new cgi script* in the www directory, make sure
it becomes executable (and possibly fix some other technical things) by running

   ./CGIfix.py

from the www directory again. You might want to just
leave a terminal window open in your www directory.

If you forget this, and the file is not executable,
nothing happens in the browser when you try to run it,
and the error message in the server window is very unhelpful -
it says  "... File not found ...".  Make sure you make new CGI files
executable!

If you create and
edit a cgi file inside Idle, remember you *cannot run it* from inside
Idle.  After editing, be **sure** to check the syntax,
using alt/option-X.
You should close the file in Idle before running ./CGIfix.py.

When you want to test a cgi script, you need localCGIServer.py running
from the www directory.
Again, assuming for illustration that you put the examples folder on
your desktop, you could type in the command:

    cd ~/desktop/examples/www

Here is a neat general alternate way to get to a folder in a terminal.
The www folder is used as an example:

* Type ``cd`` and a space and *stop - no return yet*.
* Find the www folder in the Finder and drag the www folder to the terminal:
  The full path should appear in the terminal.
* Press return to execute the command, and change the directory.

Once in the www directory enter

    ./localCGIServer.py

You can just leave the server running. If you want to stop it, you can
press Ctrl-C, or close its terminal window.  Do not forget the initial "./".

At this point you can do all the web server based activities in Chapter
4, with the *only extra step being the running of ./CGIfix.py when you*
*create a new CGI script* in the www directory, or copy one from Windows.
There are a number of steps: be sure you carefully go through the list in the tutorial.
Remember, in your web browser
with a URL starting with localhost:8080/

..  warning

    I have recently been shown an apparent problem copying scripts from Windows,
    that I though my CGIfix.py should handle, but it has not.
    When transferring a cgi file from Windows, you may want to
    open a new file window and then copy the data in from an originally Windows
    file.  Then save the new file and use ./CGIfix.py. -->

<h1>Terminal Use (Optional)</h1>
<p>To use the Handson Python Tutorial, the information above should be sufficient
to get your Mac usage going.  Terminals are quite useful in other contexts:
There are many things that can be
done from such a window that cannot be done from the Finder or with an App.</p>
<p>If you would like a bit more background, read on.</p>
<div class="section" id="navigation">
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>OS X and Unix (from which OS X is derived)
have a concept of the <em>current directory</em>
Directory is the older term for folder from when there were not pictures of
folders in a graphical interface.</p>
<p>You start in your home directory.  My login id is anh, so my home directory is
<tt class="docutils literal">/Users/anh</tt>.  Substitute your login id for your machine.
The slashes separate nested directories.  The top hard drive
directory is <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt>, which contains the directory <tt class="docutils literal">Users</tt> which contains
users' home directories, like my <tt class="docutils literal">anh</tt>.  A shorthand for your home directory
is <tt class="docutils literal">~</tt>.</p>
<p>The terminal shows a system prompt when it is ready for user input.  The prompt
can be set to show many things.  The end of the prompt is often <tt class="docutils literal">$</tt>.
Before that is often some indication of your current directory, like <tt class="docutils literal">~</tt> for
the home directory.</p>
<p>If you want to see the full name of the current directory enter the command</p>
<blockquote>
pwd</blockquote>
<p>Single commands are executed after you press the Enter key.</p>
<p>You can <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>t the contents of a directory with the <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt> command.
Unix tends to abbreviate words in commands.</p>
<p>If you use the ls command in your home directory, you should see
<tt class="docutils literal">Desktop</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Documents</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Downloads</tt>, ... listed.</p>
<p>To <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory, use the <tt class="docutils literal">cd</tt> command followed by
the directory you would like to change to.  You can use the full
name of the directory starting with <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt>, but more commonly you just indicate
where to go relative to where you are now.  <tt class="docutils literal">Desktop</tt> is a subdirectory of
your home directory, so from the home directory you can just enter</p>
<blockquote>
cd Desktop</blockquote>
<p>Here is a sequence on my computer after starting a terminal (skipping most
of the output from <tt class="docutils literal">ls</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Last login: Sat May 19 18:03:19 on ttys001
anh&#64;lucky13:~$ pwd
/Users/anh
anh&#64;lucky13:~$ ls

...
Desktop                          ...
Documents                        ...
Downloads                        ...
...

anh&#64;lucky13:~$ cd Desktop
anh&#64;lucky13:~/Desktop$ pwd
/Users/anh/Desktop
anh&#64;lucky13:~/Desktop$ cd ..
anh&#64;lucky13:~$ pwd
/Users/anh
anh&#64;lucky13:~$
</pre>
<p>Notice that the last use of the <tt class="docutils literal">cd</tt> command used directory <tt class="docutils literal">..</tt>.
That stands for the parent directory, the directory containing the
current directory.</p>
<p>If you unzipped the examples from your Desktop, you can go there with</p>
<blockquote>
cd ~/Desktop/examples</blockquote>
<p>Alter this if you put your examples somewhere else!</p>
<p>It is useful to be in the examples folder.  If you start Idle from there,
it is easy to open any of the example programs.</p>
<p>When scripts are directly called by the operating system, they look
for the proper interpreter to read them.  Our scripts are set up to look for
python3.</p>
<p>To start a regular python program from the current directory, like hello_you.py,
you would enter a command with python3 and the file name, like</p>
<blockquote>
python3 hello_you.py</blockquote>
<p>Instead of shifting to a separate Shell as in Idle, the output appears right in the
terminal window.</p>
